## Purpose
In the United States alone there were approximately 37.2 million people in poverty and approximately 580,466 people who are displaced from their homes. These populations need to have clothing that allows them to go through their day-to-day lives. For example, someone may need a new suit for an interview to get them back on their feet or a child may need a new uniform for the upcoming school year.
<br> 
<br>This application allows sponsors to see which charity needs have yet to be met. The webpages are broken down into several sections: home, about, charities, households, and contact us. The expectation of this application is to make sure that householdsâ€™ needs are adequately met.

## Thought Process

The first step I took in creating this application was searching through a variety of my passions for inspiration. From there, I searched for inefficiencies in different industries and figure out which problem I will be able to solve given a one-week time frame. My focus was specifically on how the front end would work. For example, what components I would have and what attributes would go with them so I used a white board to brainstorm and then created a wireframes and user stories. 

## Planning 
This is the frontend to the Charity app and I had to plan out how I could finish this app and the backend within one week. 

<br>1: Ideation, come up with a description of the idea, user story, ERD, wireframes. *
<br>2: Create a Springboot project. Set up models, service, and repos *
<br>3: Complete backend with full CRUD and exceptions*
<br>4: Create an Angular project with different web pages flushed out. (functionality)*
<br>5: Make sure app works and design *
<br>6: review and fix any small errors *

* add relevant information to the ReadMe
